Welcome to Andrew and Vincent's NameSayer Application.

## What is Name Sayer?

Name Sayer is a software tool to assist students in learning unfamiliar names of their classmates. Users can listen to the correct pronunciation spoken by the owner of the name themselves from the database, as well as record their own version to compare and contrast. 

## Execution
1. Open the terminal and navigate to where the NameSayer.jar file and 'names' directory is located
2. By default, the 'names' directory (responsible for holding database names) is already pre-populated with the latest database.
   If you wish to add additional names, feel free to move the wav files to this folder.
3. There should also be a 'playlists' directory, it should contain 'SOFTENG206.txt', 'ENGGEN204.txt' and 'ECON151.txt'
4. Launch the application by running the command 'java -jar NameSayer.jar'
5. If the application is launched successfully, the following files should be created. 
   1. 'combinedNames' directory
   2. 'userNames' directory
   3. ApplicationState.txt
   4. BadNames.txt
